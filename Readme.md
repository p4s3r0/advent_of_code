## Advent of Code

Here are my <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> solutions. My programming language is **Python**.  
<hr>

For Execution use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

<hr>

In _main.py_ at the top you can define the arguments **ARGS**. Where _top\_n_ defines the amount of elfes, which should be chosen out, and _file\_name_ defines the input file.

```pyt
ARGS = {
    "top_n": 3,
    "file_name": "input.txt"
}
```
