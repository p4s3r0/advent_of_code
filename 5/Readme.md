## Advent of Code Day 5

Advent of Code solution for Day **5** written in **Python**. The Puzzle description is defined in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5">AOC-Day-5</a>. 
<hr>

For Execution use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

<hr>

In _main.py_ at the top you can define the arguments **ARGS**. Where `file_name` defines the input file.

```pyt
ARGS = {
    "file_name": "inputs/input.txt"
}
```

In addition to the built in functions of python, I used the `copy` module, to deepcopy a variable.
